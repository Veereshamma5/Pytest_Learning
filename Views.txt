CREATE VIEW myview AS
    SELECT name, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
        FROM weather, cities
        WHERE city = name;

SELECT * FROM myview;

DROP VIEW view_name;

===========
Performing DML Operations on a view:
DML operations can be performed upon a table through view.
Rules to Follow:
-->  A Row can be removed from a view unless it contains:
Group Function
A Group by Clause
The Rownum Pesudo column
The Distinct key word
The columns defined by expressions
-->  Data can be added through a view, unless it contains any of the above rules and there does not exist not null columns, and without default value.
Ex:
Create view InsertDept(DeptId, DeptName, Place)
            As Select Deptno, Dname, Loc From Dept;
Inserting Data Into Dept Table Using The InsertDept View:
Ex:
Insert into InsertDept(DeptID, DeptName, Place) Values(50, ’ADMINISTRATION’, ’DELHI’); 
Updating Data in Dept Table The InsertDept View:
Ex:
Update InsertDept Set place = ’MUMBAI’ where DeptID = 50;
Deleting Data From Dept Table Using the InsertDept View:
Ex:
Delete From InsertDept where DeptID = 50;
-->  Many times these transactions look consistent but it is not true, hence care should be taken when implementing them.
Using with Check Option Clause:
-->  To ensure that DML on the view stays within the domain of the view we use the with check option clause.
-->  Views make it possible to perform referential integrity checks.
-->  Using views we can enforce constraints at database level.
-->  Using Views we can protect the data integrity, but the use is very limited.
-->  With Check option clause specifies that inserts, & updates performed through the view are not allowed to create rows that the view cannot select.
-->  Views allow integrity constraints and data validation checks to be enforced on data being inserted or updated.
Ex:
Create or Replace view EDept30
            As Select * From Emp where Deptno = 30
            WITH Check option constraint EDept30ChkView;
Create or Replace view Emanage
            As Select * From Emp where Job = ‘MANAGER’
            WITH Check option constraint EmangerView; 

Applying With Read Only Option:
-->  By adding with read only we can ensure that no DML operations are executed through view.
-->  An Attempt to perform a DML operations result in oracle server error.
Ex:
Create or Replace view EDeptRead ( EmpID, Name, Designation )
            As Select Empno, Ename, Job From Emp where Deptno = 20
            WITH Read Only;
View Constraint:
-->  In practically oracle does not enforce view constraints, but operations on views are subject to the integrity constraints defined on the underlying base tables.
-->  Constraints on views can be enforced through constraints on base tables.
Restrictions on View constraints:
-->  The view constraints are subset of table constraints.
-->  Only UNIQUE, Primary key and FOREIGN key constraints can be specified on views.
-->  The check constraint is imposed using WITH Check Option.
-->  As view is a logical table the constraints on view are not highly considered in practice.

-->  The view constraints are adopted for maintenance easiness.
